# Additional Kernel Stubs

The following functions were added as simple stubs based on `Kernel_Function_Linking_Issues.csv`. Each currently logs when called or returns a default value.

| Label | Function | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| KF13 | `XamGetPrivateEnumStructureFromHandle` | Returns a pointer to the enumerator object for a given handle. |
| KF14 | `XMsgCancelIORequest` | Placeholder for cancelling outstanding IO requests. |
| KF15 | `MmSetAddressProtect` | Stub for changing page protection; always succeeds. |
| KF16 | `XexUnloadImage` | Stubbed module unload routine. |
| KF17 | `XexLoadImage` | Stubbed loader that returns success without loading. |
| KF18 | `IoDismountVolume` | Placeholder for dismounting a volume. |
| KF19 | `NtWriteFileGather` | Stub for scatter write operations. |
| KF20 | `KeInsertQueueDpc` | Queues a DPC; currently does nothing and returns 0. |
| KF21 | `KeInitializeDpc` | Initializes a DPC structure; no real logic yet. |
| KF22 | `VdSetDisplayModeOverride` | Stub for overriding display mode. |
| KF23 | `KeSetCurrentProcessType` | Updates the stored process type value. |
| KF24 | `NetDll_XNetCleanup` | Placeholder for shutting down the XNet subsystem. |
| KF25 | `NetDll_XNetRandom` | Generates random data; not implemented. |
| KF26 | `NetDll_XNetCreateKey` | Stub for creating network keys. |
| KF27 | `NetDll_XNetRegisterKey` | Stub for registering network keys. |
| KF28 | `NetDll_XNetXnAddrToInAddr` | Converts an XNet address to an in_addr structure. |
| KF29 | `NetDll_XNetServerToInAddr` | Server address to in_addr conversion. |
| KF30 | `NetDll_XNetTsAddrToInAddr` | Title server address conversion helper. |

These stubs are not critical for basic booting but remove link errors. They will need proper implementations when networking and advanced kernel features are revisited.
