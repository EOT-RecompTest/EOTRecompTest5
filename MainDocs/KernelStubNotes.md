# Kernel Stub Functions Implemented

The following kernel related stubs were added based on the entries in
`Build_Errors_Breakdown.csv`. They currently contain minimal logic so the project
can link. Each function logs or returns default values and will require proper
implementation in the future.

| Label | Function | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| KF1 | `XNotifyDelayUI` | Accepts a delay value for UI notifications. Currently ignored. |
| KF2 | `XamLoaderGetLaunchDataSize` | Returns the size of launch data. Always `0`. |
| KF3 | `XamLoaderGetLaunchData` | Copies launch data into a buffer. Returns success with no data. |
| KF4 | `XamLoaderSetLaunchData` | Sets launch data for the next title. Stubbed to do nothing. |
| KF5 | `XamUserCreateStatsEnumerator` | Placeholder for stats enumeration creation. |
| KF6 | `XamWriteGamerTile` | Stub for writing the user's gamer tile image. |
| KF7 | `XamShowKeyboardUI` | Would display the on‐screen keyboard. Currently returns success. |
| KF8 | `XamShowGamerCardUIForXUID` | Placeholder for showing a gamer card for a given XUID. |
| KF9 | `XamShowMarketplaceUI` | Stub for opening the marketplace UI. |
| KF10 | `XamContentGetLicenseMask` | Retrieves license info for content. Always returns `0`. |
| KF11 | `XamGetOverlappedResult` | Returns results for asynchronous operations. Provides default values. |
| KF12 | `XMsgCompleteIORequest` | Completes an IO request by updating an overlapped structure. |

These stubs are non‑critical for basic emulation but are needed for linking.
They should be revisited and implemented accurately when the related features
are required.
