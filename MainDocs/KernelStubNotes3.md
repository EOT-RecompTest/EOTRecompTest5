# Additional Kernel Stubs (Set 3)

The following kernel related functions were added based on `Kernel_Function_Issues_Final.csv`. They are minimal stubs that currently log when called and may return default values. Proper implementations will be needed once the related subsystems are emulated.

| Label | Function | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| KF31 | `NetDll_XNetInAddrToXnAddr` | Placeholder for converting an IP address to an XNet address. |
| KF32 | `NetDll_XNetInAddrToString` | Converts an IP address to a string buffer. |
| KF33 | `NetDll_XNetUnregisterInAddr` | Stub for unregistering a network address. |
| KF34 | `NetDll_XNetConnect` | Initiates a network connection. |
| KF35 | `NetDll_XNetGetConnectStatus` | Retrieves connection status for a socket. |
| KF36 | `NetDll_ioctlsocket` | Generic network ioctl call. |
| KF37 | `NetDll_recvfrom` | Stubbed UDP recvfrom routine. |
| KF38 | `NetDll_sendto` | Stubbed UDP sendto routine. |
| KF39 | `NetDll_WSAGetLastError` | Returns the last network error. |
| KF40 | `XamSessionRefObjByHandle` | References a session object by handle. |
| KF41 | `XamSessionCreateHandle` | Creates a session handle for a multiplayer session. |
| KF42 | `XNetLogonGetTitleID` | Retrieves the currently logged on title ID. |
| KF43 | `XamCreateEnumeratorHandle` | Creates an enumeration handle for XAM enumerators. |
| KF44 | `XamUserGetMembershipTierFromXUID` | Looks up the membership tier for a given XUID. |
| KF45 | `XamUserGetOnlineCountryFromXUID` | Gets the online country code for a user. |
| KF46 | `MmMapIoSpace` | Maps a physical address range into the guest's virtual address space. |
| KF47 | `XAudioGetSpeakerConfig` | Returns the current speaker configuration. |

These stubs are not critical for launching titles but remove link errors. They will need further work when networking and audio functionality are implemented.
